## Step 2: Set Up Your First "Zap"

A "Zap" is Zapier's term for an automation workflow.

1. Click **"Create Zap"** in your dashboard
2. Search for **"Gmail"** as your trigger
3. Select **"New Email"** trigger
4. Connect your Gmail account (allow Zapier access)
5. Filter emails you want to automate:
   - Example: Emails from certain people
   - Example: Emails with specific keywords ("inquiry", "help", etc.)

## Step 3: Add ChatGPT to Generate Responses

1. In Zapier, click **"+"** to add an action
2. Search for **"OpenAI"** (ChatGPT integration)
3. Select **"Send Prompt"** action
4. Connect your OpenAI API key (get one at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com))
5. Create your prompt template:

The following email came in:

[EMAIL BODY]

Write a friendly, professional response that:
• Answers their question
• Keeps the tone warm and helpful
• Is under 150 words
• Includes a call-to-action


## Step 4: Send the Response

1. Add another action: **Gmail → Send Email**
2. Set:
   - **To:** `[Original Sender Email]`
   - **Subject:** `Re: [Original Subject]`
   - **Body:** `[ChatGPT Response]`
3. Click **Test & Review** to send a test email
4. If it looks good, **Publish your Zap**

## That's It!

Your automation is now live. Every email matching your filter will get an AI-generated response.

## Pro Tips

**Refine your ChatGPT prompt** - The better your prompt, the better the responses. Test different wordings.

**Use filters wisely** - Don't automate emails that need personal attention. Filter for common, repetitive emails only.

**Monitor responses** - Check automated emails for the first week to make sure quality is good.

**Upgrade when needed** - Zapier free tier has limits. Upgrade to Pro ($19.99/month) for unlimited tasks.

## Real Example

**Before automation:**
- Answer 20 similar inquiry emails per day
- 30 min/day × 5 days = 2.5 hours/week
- Year total: ~130 hours

**After automation:**
- ChatGPT + Zapier handles 80% of emails
- You review + edit 20% manually
- 30 min/week
- Year savings: ~117 hours

## FAQs

**Q: Can I use the free ChatGPT instead of API?**
A: No, you need the API ($0.002 per 1,000 tokens, very cheap). The free ChatGPT chat doesn't integrate with Zapier.

**Q: What if ChatGPT's response is bad?**
A: Improve your prompt. Be very specific about tone, length, and what you want included.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes, as long as you disclose automation to users. Add a line like: "This email was partially generated by AI but reviewed by our team."
